# Ring

Repository for the source code of the engine presented at the paper Worst-case Optimal Graph Joins in Almost No Space.

## Instructions

To run our code, **we have to install an extended version of the library SDSL**. Go to [this repository](https://github.com/wangTheTiger/sdsl-lite) and follow the instructions.

After the extended version of SDSL is installed, we have to clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. First we have to build the code with cmake. in the root directory run:

```cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build/
```

2. Download the version of Wikidata that we want to use:

- [Wikidata Filtered (about 80M triples)](http://compact-leapfrog.tk/files/wikidata-filtered-enumerated.dat).
- [Wikidata (about 1000M triples)](http://compact-leapfrog.tk/files/wikidata-enumerated.dat.gz). Note that we have to decompress this file.

Now put the .dat file inside a folder.

3. Now we have to create the index. After compiling the code we should have an executable called `build-index`. Now run:

```Bash
./build-index <absolute-path-to-the-.dat-file>
```

This will generate some files in the folder where the `.dat` file is located. **Please keep all the files in the same folder**.

4. We are ready to run the code! We should have another executable file called `query-index`, then we should run:

```Bash
./query-index <absoulute-path-to-the-.dat-file> <absolute-path-to-the-query-file>
```

Here we need to give the path of the the file that contains all the queries. Besides the `Ring` folder we should find another folder called `Queries`. We have to give the path of one of the files within it:

- If we selected the file `wikidata-filtered-enumerated.dat` we have to give the absolute path of the file called `Queries-wikidata-benchmark.txt`.
- If we selected the file `wikidata-enumerated.dat` we have to select the absolute path of the file called `Queries-wikidata-benchmark.txt`.

Now we are finished! After running this step we will execute the queries. In console we should see the number of the query, the number of results and the time taken by each one of the queries.

5. **[OPTIONAL]** If we would want to run the `CRing` code instead, you should [download this version of our source code](http://compact-leapfrog.tk/files/CRing.zip). All the steps are equivalent.

At the moment, we can find the rest of the complementary material at [this webpage](http://compact-leapfrog.tk/). Note that we will find instructions to run the code there, and although the instructions are different from the ones in this repository, they should work too.
